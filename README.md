# BMW-Pilot
Pilot project for bmw museum in Munich

Hello! We are Ukrainian students that were forced to leave our country due to Russian agression and now we are looking for the new opportunities.

The idea is to improve UX by creating website (especially for Munich BMW museum) where customer could see and interact with 3-D car models and discovery new features that would be interesting for him.

Now we are looking for integrating QR codes to make content access not only by website, but with physical images that could be placed in front of the car (directly in car shops/museums)

Currently we have:
- Internal API for accessing data from backend (read, write, update)
- Website with available 3-d models based on three.js technology

Technologies we are using:
Frontend:
- Maya 3D
- Three.js
- Figma, Miro

Backend: 
- Python, JavaScript
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- Psycopg2, binary
- Docker, Docker-compose
- Git
- GCP
